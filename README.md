# To-do List with PHP 8

This example includes a simple implementation of To-do List Web Application using NGINX, PHP 8 and PHP-FPM.
The example is fully containerized.

## Running this example

Running this example the easy way requires Docker to be installed on your computer.
If you have Docker installed you can simply clone this repository, then run `docker compose up` in the root directory (the one containing the `docker-compose.yml` file). The application will be available at http://localhost:8080.

If you do not wish to use Docker, you will need to manually install and configure NGINX and PHP-FPM. A nice tutorial is [available on DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/php-fpm-nginx). 
A more beginner-friendly alternative might be to install a PHP development environment such as [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/), which is available for Windows, Linux and OS X, or [WAMP](https://www.wampserver.com/en/), which is only available for Windows.

If you are a student from the Web Technologies course at the Universit√† degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, note that this will be the first and last time we use PHP! You are not **not** required to install a PHP execution environment, and I suggest you run this example using Docker!
